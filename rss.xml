This influx of funds will undoubtedly aid the company in further expanding its services and offerings, catering to the increasing demand for travel experiences. However, in a surprising turn of events, both YouTube and Spotify have decided not to launch their Apple Vision Pro apps, following in the footsteps of Netflix. This decision highlights a growing trend of major streaming platforms distancing themselves from Apple's latest venture. Meanwhile, lawmakers are taking action to prevent meatpacking giant JBS from trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The move comes as concerns over deforestation and its links to the company's operations have been raised. This development showcases the increasing focus on environmental sustainability and the efforts being made to hold corporations accountable for their impact on the planet.</summary></entry></feed>
