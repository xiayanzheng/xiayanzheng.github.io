This comes after certain changes were made to the App Store. The popular game had previously been removed from the platform due to a dispute between its developer, Epic Games, and Apple. However, with the new adjustments, European players can once again enjoy the immersive gaming experience on their iPhones and iPads. In another development, a new tool called NativeVision has been introduced, aiming to assist React Native developers in creating extended reality (XR) applications for various devices. This tool is expected to enhance the capabilities of developers and enable them to build XR apps more efficiently. Additionally, Harvard scholars have recently released a report highlighting a concerning trend in the United States. According to their findings, a record number of Americans are now spending over half of their income on rent. This alarming statistic sheds light on the increasing financial burden faced by many individuals and families across the country.</summary></entry></feed>
