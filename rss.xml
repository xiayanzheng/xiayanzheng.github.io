The country recognizes the importance of maintaining a strong position in the international education landscape and is determined to reverse the trend. Meanwhile, a concerning discovery has been made regarding crashes in the HTTP server used in routers. Through a simple fuzzing technique, vulnerabilities were identified, raising concerns about the security of these widely used devices. On a different note, an innovative web design tool has been developed using only 30 lines of pure HTML web component code and an additional file, without the need for node or JavaScript. This tool allows for the creation of text-shadow wave animations, showcasing the power of HTML in web development. Lastly, the security of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) has come into question, as its dark side is revealed. Despite being widely used for authentication and authorization purposes, JWT is not as secure as initially believed. This revelation highlights the need for caution and further exploration of alternative security measures.</summary></entry></feed>
