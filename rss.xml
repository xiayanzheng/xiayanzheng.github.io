However, this year, there seems to be a slight shift in the landscape. Researchers from the University of Tubingen have proposed a new AI approach called SIGNeRF, which focuses on fast and controllable NeRF scene editing and scene-integrated object generation. Additionally, a new open-source and lightweight masked image model called aMUSEd has been introduced for text-to-image generation based on MUSE. In other news, a study conducted by John Wiley has managed to solve the mystery surrounding magic mushrooms using LC-MS/MS determination of psilocin in whole blood. Unfortunately, there have also been obituaries reported, including one for Bertha Wiley at Hillside Memorial Chapel &amp; Gardens and another for Addam Mitchell "Mitch" Wiley at Rose-Neath Funeral Homes. Congressman Wiley Nickel has made a statement regarding the January 6th assault, calling it one of the darkest days in U.S. history. On a different note, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has been revealed to be working on a secret military drone project. Lastly, a survey has found that almost a third of employees feel discouraged from coming into the office when their boss is present.</summary></entry></feed>
